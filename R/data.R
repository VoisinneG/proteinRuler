#' A dataset containing the characterization of protein groups identified from lysates of mouse effector CD4+ 
#' T cells duting the course of TCR stimulation
#' Samples correspond to Cd4+ T cells from WT mice stimulated by cross-linking of Cd3e 
#' and Cd4 for different times (0, 30, 120, 300 and 600 seconds).
#' Samples were frozen, lysed and subjected to MS-MS analysis.
